book: Core.254
die: 1d10
rolls:
  - range: [1, 1]
    name: 
    effect: | 
      The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.
  - range: [2, 2]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The attack sends a fracture through the limb. The target drops anything held in the hand and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [3, 3]
    name:
    effect: |
      The explosion takes 1d5 fingers from the target’s hand. The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and anything carried in the
      hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive, it goes off. Messy.
  - range: [4, 4]
    name: 
    effect: | 
      The blast causes the target to howl in agony. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is
      useless until medical attention is received.
  - range: [5, 5]
    name: 
    effect: |
      Fragments from the explosion tear into the target’s hand, ripping away flesh and muscle alike. He must immediately
      Test Toughness or lose the hand. Even on a success, the hand is useless until medical attention is received. The target
      takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh turning the target’s arm into a red ruin, inflicting 1d5
      levels of Fatigue. The target’s arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition,
      the horrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      In a violent hail of flesh, the arm is blown apart. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness
      Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers
      Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      The arm disintegrates under the force of the explosion taking a good portion of the shoulder and chest with it. The
      target is sent screaming to the ground, where he dies in a pool of his own blood and organs.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target’s body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood droplets. In
      addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power sword or chainsword)
      then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within two metres.
  - range: [10,1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (dead, ammunition explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact at 1d10 metres), except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within
      1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding power weapons noted above). If the target is carrying
      any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on his person.
