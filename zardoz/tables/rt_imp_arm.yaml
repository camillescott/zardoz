    effect: | 
      The impact leaves the target reeling from pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round. The limb is useless for 1d5 Rounds
      and the target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
  - range: [5, 5]
    name: 
    effect: |
      Muscle and bone take a pounding as the attack rips into the arm. The target’s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill are both
      halved (round down) for 1d10 Rounds. In addition, the target takes 1 level of Fatigue and must make an Agility Test or
      drop anything held in that hand.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The attack pulverises the target’s hand, crushing and breaking 1d5 fingers (for the purposes of this Critical, a thumb
      counts a finger). The target takes 1 level of Fatigue and must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test
      or lose the use of his hand.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      With a loud snap, the arm bone is shattered and left hanging limply at the target’s side, dribbling blood onto the
      ground. The arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      The force of the attack takes the arm off just below the shoulder, showering blood and gore across the ground. The
      target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he passes the Test, he is still
      Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is suffers from Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      In a rain of blood, gore and meat, the target’s arm is removed from his body. Screaming incoherently, he twists about in
      agony for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground and dying.
  - range: [10, 1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (arm removed, incoherent screaming, then dead), except as the arm is removed it is smashed apart by the force of 
      the attack, and bone, clothing and armour
      fragments fly bout like shrapnel. Anyone within 2 metres of the target suffers 1d5–3 Impact Damage to a random
      location (see Table 9-8: Hit Locations, `rt_hit_loc`).
