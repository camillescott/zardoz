    effect: |
      As the blow rips violently across the target’s face—it takes with it an important feature. Roll 1d10 to see what the
      target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see Permanent Effects on Core.201), 4–7: Nose (permanently halve Fellowship), 8–10: Ear
      (permanently reduce Fellowship by 1d10; the wound can always be hidden with hair.) In addition, the target is now
      suffering Blood Loss and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      In a splatter of skin and teeth, the attack removes most of the target’s face. He is permanently blinded and has his
      Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurring his words. In addition,
      the target is suffering from Blood Loss and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      The blow slices into the side of the target’s head causing his eyes to pop out and his brain to ooze down his cheek like
      spilled jelly. He’s dead before he hits the ground.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      With a sound not unlike a wet sponge being torn in half, the target’s head flies free of its body and sails through the air,
      landing harmlessly 2d10 metres away with a soggy thud. The target is instantly slain.
  - range: [10, 1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (decapitation), except the target’s neck spews blood in a torrent, drenching all those nearby and forcing them to make a
      Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Anyone who fails the Test suffers a –10 penalty to his Weapon Skill and Ballistic
      Skill Tests for 1 Round as gore fills his eyes or fouls his visor.
