      that hand.
  - range: [4, 4]
    name: 
    effect: | 
      The attack flays the skin from the limb, filling the air with lood and the sounds of his screaming. The target falls prone
      from the agony and takes 2 levels of Fatigue. The limb is useless for 1d10 Rounds.
  - range: [5, 5]
    name: 
    effect: |
      A bloody and very painful looking furrow is opened up in the target’s arm. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue
      and vomits all over the place in agony. He drops whatever was held and the limb is useless until medical attention is
      received. The target also suffers Blood Loss.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The blow mangles flesh and muscle as it hacks into the target’s hand, liberating 1d5 fingers in the process (a roll of
      a 5 means that the thumb has been sheared off ). The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and must immediately make a
      Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or lose the use of his hand.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The attack rips apart skin, muscle, bone and sinew with ease, turning the target’s arm into a dangling ruin and inflicting
      1d5 levels of Fatigue. The arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition,
      numerous veins have been severed and the target is now suffering from Blood Loss.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      With an assortment of unnatural, wet ripping sounds, the arm flies free of the body trailing blood behind it in a crimson
      arc. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he passes the Test,
      he is Stunned for 1d10 Turns and suffers Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and now has only one arm.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      The attack slices clean through the arm and into the torso, drenching the ground in blood and gore and killing the
      target instantly.
  - range: [10, 1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (rather dead). However, as the arm falls to the ground its fingers spasm uncontrollably, pumping the trigger of any held
      weapon. If the target was carrying a ranged weapon there is a 5% chance that a single randomly determined target
      within 2d10 metres will be hit by these shots, in which case resolve a single hit from the target’s weapon as normal.
