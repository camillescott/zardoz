    name: 
    effect: | 
      A glancing blast sends the character backwards one metre.
  - range: [2, 2]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The force of the explosion takes the target’s feet out from under him. He lands Prone and takes 1 level of Fatigue.
  - range: [3, 3]
    name:
    effect: |
      The concussion cracks the target’s leg, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and halving all movement for 1d5 Rounds.
      The target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
  - range: [4, 4]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The explosion sends the target spinning through the air. The target travels 1d5 metres away from the explosion
      and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. It takes the target a Full Action to regain his feet and he halves all
      movement for 1d10 Rounds.
  - range: [5, 5]
    name: 
    effect: |
      Explosive force removes part of the target’s foot and scatters it over a wide area. The target must make an immediate
      Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. On a
      success, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and halves his movement until he receives medical attention.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The concussive force of the blast shatters the target’s leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levels of
      Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, the horrendous
      nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The explosion reduces the target’s leg into a hunk of smoking meat. The target must immediately make a Challenging
      (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d10
      levels of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      The blast tears the leg from the body in a geyser of gore, sending him crashing to the ground, blood pumping from the
      ragged stump: instantly fatal.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragments of bone, clothing,
      and armour hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres of the target takes 1d10+2 Impact Damage.
  - range: [10,1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (dead, 1d10+2 Impact at 2 metres from leg hunks), except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes
      dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target’s person.
