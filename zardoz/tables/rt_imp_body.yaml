      The attack knocks the target sprawling on the ground. The target flies 1d5 metres away from the attacker and falls

    effect: |
      With an audible crack, 1d5 of the target’s ribs break. The target can either lay down and stay still awaiting medical
      attention (a successful Medicae Test sets the ribs) or continue to take Actions, though each Round there is a 20% chance
      that a jagged rib pierces a vital organ and kills the character instantly. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.

      crumpling to the ground dead.

    effect: |
      As in 9 (spews out a jet of blood and fucking dies), except the target is thrown 1d10 metres away from the attack.
      Anyone in the target’s path must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or be Knocked Down.
