    effect: |
      The explosion flays the flesh from the target’s face and bursts his eardrums with its force. The target is Stunned for
      1d10 Rounds and is permanently deafened. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and can only take Half Actions for
      1d5 hours. Finally, the target’s Fellowship drops by 1d10 due to hideous scarring.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The target’s head explodes under the force of the attack, leaving his headless corpse to spurt blood from the neck for
      the next few minutes. Needless to say this is instantly fatal.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      Both head and body are blown into a mangled mess, instantly killing the target. In addition, if the target is carrying any
      ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to any creatures within 1d5 metres. If the target was carrying
      grenades or missiles, these too explode on the target’s person.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      In a series of unpleasant explosions the target’s head and torso peel apart, leaving a gory mess on the ground. For the
      rest of the fight, anyone moving over this spot must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall prone.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      The target ceases to exist in any tangible way, entirely turning into a kind of crimson mist. You don’t get much deader
      than this, except...
  - range: [10,1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (pink mist), except such is the unspeakably appalling manner in which the target was killed, that any of the target’s allies
      who are within two metres of where the target stood must make an immediate Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or
      spend their next Turn fleeing from the attacker.
