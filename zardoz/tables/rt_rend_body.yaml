      A torrent of blood spills from the deep cuts, making the ground slick with gore. All characters attempting to move

      The attack cuts open the target’s abdomen. The target can either choose to use one arm to hold his guts in (until a
      medic can bind them in place with a successful Medicae Test), or fight on regardless and risk a 20% chance each turn
      that his middle splits open, spilling his intestines all over the ground, causing an additional 2d10 Damage. In either

      levels of Fatigue, and now suffers Blood Loss.
