      The target’s head bursts like an overripe fruit and sprays blood, bone and brains in all directions. Anyone within 4
      metres of the target must make an Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to their WS and BS on their next Turn as gore
      gets in their eyes or on their visors.

    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (head explodes, within 4 metres Agility Test or -10 WS and BS next Turn), except that the attack was so powerful that it passes through the target and may hit another target nearby. If
      the hit was from a melee weapon, the attacker may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against
      any other target they can reach without moving. If the hit was from a ranged weapon they may immediately make
      another attack (with the same weapon) against any target standing directly behind the original target and still within
      range of their weapon.
