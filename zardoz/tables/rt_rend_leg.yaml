      and suffers Blood Loss.

      In a spray of blood, the target’s leg is opened up, exposing bone, sinew and muscle. The target takes 1d5 levels of
      Fatigue and halves his movement for 1d10 hours.
  - range: [6, 6]
    name:
    effect: |
      The blow slices a couple of centimetres off the end of the target’s foot. The target must make an immediate
      Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot. On a success, movement is halved until he
      receives medical attention. In either case, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [7, 7]
    name: 
    effect: |
      The force of the blow cuts deep into the leg, grinding against bone and tearing ligaments apart. The leg is broken and,
      until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, the level of maiming is such that the target is now
      suffering from Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
  - range: [8, 8]
    name:
    effect: |
      In a single bloody hack the leg is lopped off the target, spurting its vital fluids across the ground. The target must
      immediately make a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, takes
      1d10 Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.
  - range: [9, 9]
    name:
    effect: |
      With a meaty chop, the leg comes away at the hip. The target pitches to the ground howling in agony, before dying
      moments later.
  - range: [10, 1000]
    name:
    effect: |
      As in 9 (very dead), except that the tide of blood is so intense that, for the remainder of the battle, anyone making a Run or
      Charge Action within six metres of the target this Turn must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall over.
